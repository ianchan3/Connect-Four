# :video_game: Connect-Four
The game of Connect Four involves two players strategically placing their game pieces onto a board measuring 7 columns by 6 rows. The game objective is to achieve a win by forming a line of four pieces either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. In the event that neither player achieves this, and the board is fully occupied, the game results in a draw.
